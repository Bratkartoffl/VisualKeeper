		<h2>Photo Storage - PhoneGap File Transfer and Server Side PHP</h2>
		<p>In the previous section we learned how to capture photos using Phonegap, now we will cover how to upload that photo to a server using Phonegap. We will be using the <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.2.0/cordova_file_file.md.html#FileTransfer" target="_blank">File Transfer API</a> from Phonegap. This method that I used to upload the file I learned from another tutorial from Zac Vineyard <a href="http://zacvineyard.com/blog/2011/03/upload-a-file-to-a-remote-server-with-phonegap">Upload a File to a Remote Server with Phonegap</a> so you can always check that out for some more information.</p>
		<p>In our acceptNewTask function we will be calling a function to upload the photo to our image server. The first step is to get a web server running. We used a web host who handled most of the setup, just make sure the server can run php scripts. The server will need to run two php scripts, one to create new users and one to upload photos. I will go over these scripts after I go over the image upload script.</p>
		<p>To upload the photo we need to do some preparation steps. We have to create a FileUploadOptions object so we can fill it with options to pass to the upload. Then we create a parameter object which will hold other POST variables that will be sent with the image. In our case these will be things like the userid, taskid and picture id. These will be used to build the file name and path, that way when we need to get an image from the server we can just build the url from the user id, task id and picture id. Then we create a FileTransfer object and use its upload function to upload to the server. Here is the code from Visual Keeper</p>
		<div class="codeSample">
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/4248824.js"> </script>
		</div>
		<p>Now lets break this function down. The first two lines create the options and parameter objects. Then we start adding options. These options will change the way the php script accesses uploaded file. The first option is the fileKey which is used to get the file from the uploaded file array. The fileName option is the name of the file to be uploaded. In this case we just upload the last part of the file (eg. 'xxxx.jpg'), our server is gonna rename the file anyway so we don't really care what we set it to. The mimeType option is used to say what kind of file is being uploaded to the server. Then we set the parameters such as user id, task id and picture id. We then add the paramter object to the options object. The last option we set is chunkedMode. I'm not really sure what it does to be honest, I just know that on Android I could not get the photo to upload correctly without setting chunkedMode to false.</p>
		<p>Then on line 17 we create the FileTransfer object and call upload on that object. The upload function takes the image URI of the image as the first argument. To get this value we just grabbed it from the src attribute of the main task image. The second argument is the address of the upload script on the web server. The third argument to the upload function is an object containing the success and error callback functions. The last argument is the options object we created. This code just sends the file, without the proper server code no file will be saved.</p>
		<p>We used two php scripts on the server, the first one is used to create a folder for each user when they register. That folder will be used to store the image files for that user. We created a folder on the server called user_images that will hold all of the user folders. The php script will take in a user id via a GET variable and create a new folder on the server. Here is the code for the 'makeNewUser.php' script used on the Visual Keeper server: </p>
		<div class="codeSample">
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/4248895.js"> </script>
		</div>
		<p>The first line of the script gets the user id from the GET variable. The second line makes the relative path for the new folder. This path must include the new folder or it won't be created. The if statment has the mkdir function in it. The mkdir function will create a new folder in the path you give it, so if the mkdir function fails to create that folder, the script will stop. This script is called in the register function to create a new folder for a user that just registered on parse. We use this line to call the php script:<br>
			<code>
				$.get("http://www.serveraddress.com/services/makeNewUser.php?id="+CurrentUser.id);
			</code>
			<br>
		This line will call make the 'makeNewUser.php' script run on the server and the script will attempt to create a folder for the current user.</p>
		<p>So now that we have a script that sets up the server for receiving files, we have to make a script to actually receive files. This script will be called 'upload.php' and it will take in the parameters as POST variables and the uploaded image. The server will then move the uploaded image from a temporary location to the proper user's folder. Here is the Visual Keeper 'upload.php':</p>
		<div class="codeSample">
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/4248923.js"> </script>
		</div>
		<p>This script gets the user id, task id and photo id from the POST variables. It then builds the image path by putting these three variables together. The path should be relative to the folder that contains the php scripts. I had tried to use an absolute path at first and I could not get the image to upload. The if statement on line 8 calls the 'move_uploaded_file' function. The 'move_uploaded_file' function takes in the temporary path to the photo and the path you want to move the file to. To get the actual file from the upload you use the $_FILES variable. $_FILES is a multidimensional array, the first index we want to select the file key we set which was 'file' and the second index we set to "tmp_name". That gets the temp location of the file on the server so it can move it to the permanent location we built earlier in the script. For more information on the 'move_uploaded_file' function you can check the php docs here <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.move-uploaded-file.php" target="_blank">PHP - move_uploaded_file</a>.</p>
		<p>Once you have these scripts set up on the server and you have the proper functions set up on your app, the image should upload. If you are having trouble with the upload, use the <a href="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.error-log.php" target="_blank">php error_log function</a> to output debug information to the server's error log. Once you get images uploaded you should write a function on your javascript file to build a photo's URL from the task information. Here is the one we used in Visual Keeper:</p>
		<div class="codeSample">
			<script src="https://gist.github.com/4248989.js"> </script>
		</div>
		<p>This function makes it simple to get the img URL from a given task information. Whenever you want to use the image in the app you just set the src of the img tag to the URL created by this function.</p>
		<p>With a little luck you will get the images to upload and work correctly. To see the php scripts for this section they are on Github at <a href="https://github.com/jaredcahalan/VisualKeeper/blob/master/VisualKeeper/assets/www/js/myscript.js">Visual Keeper - myscript.js</a></p>

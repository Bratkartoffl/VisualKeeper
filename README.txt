Visual Keeper
Jared Cahalan, Abel Sanchez

Visual Keeper allows you store tasks and other to-do list information with a focus on using images to show task information. After registering an account you can begin adding tasks and viewing them. Visual Keeper provides you with a way to combine images with short simple task descriptions to easily share the task with other people. Images and data are stored on a remote server so unfortunately at this time you need a data/web connection to view them.

Step 1: Download App through Phonegap Build Page, please remember to allow Unknown Sources in you setting s to allow installation of the app.

Step 2: When the app is opened you are faced with a login screen, a register button and a reset password button. The login portion is pretty self explanatory just enter your already created username and password. The register button will give the user that ability to create a personal account through Visual Keeper to save your tasks. The reset password button will allow the user to reset their passord via an emailed link that is sent to the email that the user used in the register process, so try not to use a dummy email if you would like to use the app frequently.

The add task page and main page are almost complete. There is an issue with the date time input field not working correctly on the device. It should show a date and time picker, but instead just opens the keyboard. On the jQuery Mobile docs page the datetime input field works as it should but I'm not sure why ours isn't. I might just end up making a popup widget with some forms to make a custom date/time picker. The phonegap photo api is used to take the photos. The input fields are not storing anything yet but once we get the storage worked out they will be. The main page displays a list of tasks and right now it is set to just display an example task when you make a new task. The image is just a placeholder until we get the theme for the whole app figured out.

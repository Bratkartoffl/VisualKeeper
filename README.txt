Visual Keeper
Jared Cahalan, Abel Sanchez

Visual Keeper allows you store tasks and other to-do list information with a focus on using images to show task information. After registering an account you can begin adding tasks and viewing them. Visual Keeper provides you with a way to combine images with short simple task descriptions to easily share the task with other people. Images and data are stored on a remote server so unfortunately at this time you need a data/web connection to view them.
